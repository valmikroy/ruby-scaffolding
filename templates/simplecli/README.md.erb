# rubycli-<%= snake_name %>
This simple CLI structure creates `thor` based CLI utility in single file. This is useful to write quick throw away CLI script. 

## structure
```
rubycli-<%= snake_name %>
├── Gemfile
├── LICENSE
├── Rakefile
├── bin
│   └── <%= snake_name %>.rb
├── rubocop.yml
└── spec
    ├── <%= snake_name %>_spec.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb

```

In above structure , `bin/<%= snake_name %>.rb` has been divided logically in three sections
- Singleton (self) which initialize logger and other global variables.
- `Helpers` which can hold all helpers to build action flow.
- `CLI` which holds entry points for each type of flow respective to given command line.

It also drops `spec/<%= snake_name %>_spec.rb` which can be fleshed out during development.
